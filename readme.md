# AI Enabled Visa Status & Processing Time Estimator

# Milestone 1: Data collection and preprocessing.

## Objective
- To prepare a clean and structured dataset for predicting visa case status and processing time using machine learning.

## Data Loading
- Loaded raw visa data from datasets/raw_data.csv
- Performed initial inspection (head, info, null checks)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values:
- Categorical → filled with "Unknown"
- Numerical → filled with median values
- Fixed data types for numerical and date columns
- Standardized categorical labels

## Encoded categorical and binary data
- Lable encoding for binary categorical values(has_job_experience, requires_job_training,full_time_positon)
- One hot encoding for categorical feaures (continent, region of employment, and education level)

## Date Handling
- Generated synthetic application_date (2016–2024)
- Created decision_date using processing time
- Extracted application_year and application_month
- Dropped raw date fields after extraction

## Processing Time Generation
- Generated realistic processing_time_days using rule-based logic
- Factors considered: job type, wage, company size, case status

## Feature Engineering
- Created company_age from year of establishment
- Normalized wages to annual format
- Removed unused or redundant columns

## Target Preparation
- Standardized visa outcomes:
- Certified → Approved 

#### Identified targets:
- Classification: case_status
- Regression: processing_time_days

## Final Dataset
- Selected final feature set
- Exported cleaned dataset as:Final_Cleaned.csv

# Milestone 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering
## Objective
- To analyze the cleaned dataset, extract insights, and prepare meaningful features for machine learning models.

## Steps Completed
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations and correlation analysis.
- Analyzed relationships between input features and target variables:
- 1. case_status
- 2. processing_time_days
- Generated correlation heatmaps, including filtered correlations (|corr| > 0.1).
- Identified weak linear correlations and justified feature engineering for non-linear models.

## Feature Engineering
- Created wage bands (low, medium, high, very high).
- Categorized company size (small, medium, large, enterprise).
- Generated seasonal features and peak-season indicator.
- Added region-level processing indicator.
- Ensured all engineered features are binary (0/1).

## Outcome
- Final dataset contains fully numeric, model-ready features.
- Dataset is prepared for classification and regression modeling in the next milestone.

# Milestone 3: Predictive Modeling & Model Selection 
- This milestone involves the development, tuning, and selection of machine learning models to predict US Visa outcomes. 

## The project is split into two primary objectives:
- Classification: Predicting if a visa will be Approved or Denied.

- Regression: Predicting the exact Processing Time (Days).

## Technical Implementation
### 1. Case Status Prediction (Classification)
We evaluated multiple classifiers to handle the imbalanced nature of visa approvals.

- Models Tested: Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
- Optimization: Utilized RandomizedSearchCV with a focus on F1-Score to balance Precision and Recall. 
- Winner: Tuned Gradient Boosting (Selected for its superior generalization and low variance between training and test sets).

### 2. Processing Time Prediction (Regression)
Predicted the duration of the visa application process based on engineered features.

- Models Tested: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and HistGradientBoostingRegressor (HGBR).
- Optimization: Optimized $R^2$ using Permutation Importance to identify key drivers like visa_type and application_year.
- Winner: HGBR (Achieved a final $R^2$ Score of 0.97).

# Milestone 4: Web Application Development & Deployment
- Developed and Deployed a full-stack Flask application that uses the models which were trained in previous milestones

## Key Features 
- ML Predictions: Real-time classification (Certified/Denied) and regression (Processing Days).
- AI Analysis: Personalized "Pro-Tips" generated by Gemini 1.5 Flash based on user data.
- User System: Secure authentication with hashed passwords and session management.
- History Tracking: Logged-in users can view their past assessment records.
- Cloud Hosted: Fully deployed on Render with a managed PostgreSQL database.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask), SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login
- Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
